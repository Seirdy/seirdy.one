/* CSS that adds the bare minimum for a simple, accessible,
 * touch-friendly layout.
 * Nothing here exists purely for cosmetics; everything addresses a
 * specific a11y, compatibility, or critical
 * usability need.
 *
 * Three exceptions:
 * - I re-set the input styles so Safari wouldn't make them pill-shaped
 * - I tweaked some margins/paddings to make some things evenly aligned
 * - I made my IndieWeb profile photo align without an underline
 *   on the whitespace between the photo and my name.
 *
 * I also don't use any non-microformats classes except when styling
 * depends on *content* of an element rather than structure/semantics.
 * Examples include images that look better with pixelated upscaling,
 * and posts on the list of entries in the "notes" section that are tall
 * and need a larger contain-intrinsic-size.
 * One exception: a class for narrow width body text.
 *
 * Some pages (e.g. post archives) are really long despite having a
 * small download size. Rather than resort to pagination, I decided to
 * use CSS containment and content-visibility. I test performance on
 * browsers with heavy throttling and no GPU acceleration to ensure that
 * they're gentle on the CPU. For instance, Lighthouse benchmarks my
 * machine's CPU power at 1200-1300 and recommends 2.8-3.0x throttling;
 * I throttle at 12-15x.
 *
 * "content-visibility: auto" implies containment; however, some
 * browsers don't support "content-visibility: auto" but do support the
 * "contain" property. To be consistent across all these browsers, I
 * therefore use both even if it's a bit redundant. Once the latest
 * Safari has supported "content-visibility: auto" for a year or so and
 * it's in the latest version of the Tor Browser (which typically uses
 * whatever the latest Firefox-ESR was a month or two ago), I'll
 * consider removing these redundancies. I'll probably have to wait two
 * years.
 *
 * To keep myself from caring about minute details, I limited myself to
 * only defining spacing in increments of .25em. Pixels are 1px or
 * multiples of 3px. This also improves compression. No more "finding
 * the perfect value".
 *
 * I cite WCAG 2.2 success criteria with "SC". I also tried to meet
 * the Google a11y requirement of 48px tap targets separated by atl
 * 8px, excluding inline links. This involved increasing font size,
 * padding, line-height, and margins. */
