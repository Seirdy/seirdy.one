/* CSS that adds the bare minimum for a simple layout.
 * Nothing here exists purely for aesthetics except the unstyled-list;
 * everything else addresses a specific a11y, compatibility, or critical
 * usability need. */

/* This site's CSS does 10 major things:
 * 1. sans-serif instead of serif for low-res screens.
 * 2. Consistent font size; <pre> and <code> shouldn't be smaller than
 *    regular text.
 * 3. max content width for readability
 * 4. single-row nav links widescreen, multiline nav on narrow screens
 * 5. Soft border around code and images to disginguish from the
 *    surrounding page. Images with white/black or transparent
 *    backgrounds should have clear dimensions, and multiple consecutive
 *    inline <code> spans should look separate. A <code> span that
 *    continues across multiple lines should not look like multiple different
 *    spans.
 * 6. Increase the line-spacing a bit so users on mobile devices can
 *    tap links more easily.
 * 7. Horizontally center non-inline images; left-aligned stick out.
 * 8. dark.css changes a few colors if the browser wants dark mode.
 * 9. Support unstyled lists: for webmentions, post lists, nav links.
 * 10. Narrow screen optimization: less-indented blockquotes, overflow
 *     behavior for <pre>, no figure margins.
 * Everything else is browser defaults:
 * default fonts, non-dark-mode colors, etc.

 * - Some browsers don't scale SVGs properly; the img container

 *   other uncommon browsers too. If any non-IE browsers do this and/or
 *   if the spec allows this behavior, try to correct it here.
 * - Investigate reduced-contrast for dark mode
 * - Wait till Webkit fixes its broken-ass default dark stylesheet
 *   then consider trimming the dark stylesheet I provide.
 * - Narrow screen optimization for bullet indents.
 * - Investigate CSS-based hints to screenreaders.
 * - See if any "-left" properties should switch to "-right" for users
 *   who machine-translate the page to a RTL language. */
