# I'm not blocking CCBot for now. It publishes a free index for anyone to use.
# Googe used this to train the initial version of Bard (now called Gemini).
# I allow CCBot since its index is also used for upstart/hobbyist search engines
# like Alexandria and for genuinely useful academic work I personally like.
# I allow Owler for similar reasons:
# <https://openwebsearch.eu/owler/#owler-opt-out>
# <https://openwebsearch.eu/common-goals-with-common-crawl/>.
# Omgilibot/Omgili is similar to CCBot, except it sells the scrape results.
