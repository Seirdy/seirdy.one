<https://seirdy.one/> | <seirdy@seirdy.one>

Detail oriented, committed and self-motivated, open-source enthusiast proficient in technologies related to Python, Go, Linux and UNIX systems, and cloud-native computing looking for an internship.

Education: Lewis and Clark College
----------------------------------

Bachelor of Arts, Major in Math and Computer Science, Minor in Physics.

Fall 2018 - Spring 2022 (expected)

### Selected Coursework

- Computer Architecture/Assembly Lang
- Programming Language Structures
- Cybersecurity Fundamentals
- Networking Basics (CCNA)

Work Experience
---------------

### June-August 2019: Software Engineering Intern, SAP Ariba, Palo Alto

Developed an anomaly detection and seasonal forecasting tool in Golang using Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) techniques to smooth time series data. It was capable of scaling to over one million historical points from InfluxDB, real-time, in an extensively configurable manner. Use cases include detecting a server's anomalous spikes in resource usage and analyzing trends in environmental data.

Projects
--------

Git repositories on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~seirdy), [GitHub](https://github.com/Seirdy), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Seirdy)

### Clogstats

[sr.ht/~seirdy/clogstats](https://sr.ht/~seirdy/clogstats)

Gathers IRC channel activity statistics from WeeChat logs and performs time-series analysis and forecasting on them. It can quantify, rank, and chart chatting activity over time and display forecasts. It can also detect anomalous increases in activity.

Tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas.
