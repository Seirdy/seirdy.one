Detail oriented, committed, self-motivated, open-source enthusiast proficient in Python, Go, Linux/UNIX systems, and cloud-native computing looking for an internship.

Education: Lewis and Clark College
----------------------------------

Bachelor of Arts, Major in Math and Computer Science. Fall 2018 - Spring 2023 (expected)

Certifi&shy;cations {#certifications}
--------------

CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601), Dec. 2021. Verification available upon request.

Work Experience
---------------

### June-August 2019: Software Engineering Intern, SAP Ariba, Palo Alto

Developed an anomaly detection and seasonal forecasting tool in Go (Golang) to smooth over one million historical points from InfluxDB, real-time, in an extensively configurable manner. The approach moved processing in-memory to achieve a speedup of several orders of magnitude with a minimal footprint. Use cases included detecting a server's anomalous spikes in resource usage and analyzing trends in environmental data. Used Go, shell, and Grafana.

### June-August 2021: Software Engineering Intern, Cisco, Remote

Worked with a remote team on YAML-based data serialization and validation of data streamed in from Redfish and Selenium test suites to ensure compliance with a schema. Developed Redshift and Selenium tests for Cisco Intersight's APIs and user interface. Used Python.

Portfolio
---------

Git repositories mirrored across [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~seirdy), [GitHub](https://github.com/Seirdy), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Seirdy). Selected projects:

### Clogstats: [sr.ht<wbr>/~seirdy<wbr>/clogstats](https://sr.ht/~seirdy/clogstats)

Gathers IRC channel activity statistics from WeeChat logs and performs time-series analysis and forecasting on them. It can quantify, rank, and chart chatting activity over time and display forecasts. It can also detect anomalous increases in activity. Written in Python with NumPy and Pandas.

### MOAC: [sr.ht<wbr>/~seirdy<wbr>/MOAC](https://sr.ht/~seirdy/MOAC/)

Analyze password strength given physical limits to computing, and generate secure passwords. Computes theoretical limits to a brute-force attack limited by given physical quantities (mass, energy, power, temperature, etc.) and generates passwords to withstand them. This provides a future-proof understanding of password strength. Extensively tested. Written in Go.
