Other versions of this website
------------------------------

In addition to its [canonical url](https://seirdy.one), a "rough draft" of this website also exists on my [Tildeverse page](https://envs.net/~seirdy/ "{itemprop='sameAs' class='u-url' rel='me'}"). This site's content also appears on my [Gemini capsule](gemini://seirdy.one "{itemprop='sameAs' class='u-syndication' rel='me'}").

About me
--------

The Director's Cut of my bio is at my [About page](/about.html).

<div class="p-note">

I care a lot about accessibility, and often use screen readers and forced colors to deal with overstimulation. I'm a <abbr title="Free, Libre, and Open-Source">FLOSS</abbr> enthusiast, software minimalist, and a CS+Math undergrad who likes watching anime and tweaking his Linux setup. Current interests include search engines, security, privacy, and the IndieWeb.

My perspective on software freedom is a bit different from the FSF's; I've been trying to distance myself from "fossbro" culture.
