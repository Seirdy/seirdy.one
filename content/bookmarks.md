Here's a filtered selection of my personal bookmarks. Using [a shell script](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles/tree/master/Executables/shell-scripts/bin/buku-upload), I regularly export specially-tagged entries from my [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku) database to [a JSON file](https://seirdy.one/data/bookmarks.json). During site rebuilds, Hugo automatically pulls content from that file to build this page. This approach allows me to use an interactive interface to build my bookmarks database without needing a dynamic site.
