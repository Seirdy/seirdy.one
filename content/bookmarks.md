Here's a filtered selection of my personal bookmarks.

[A shell script](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles/tree/master/Executables/shell-scripts/bin/buku-upload) exports [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku) entries to [a JSON file](https://seirdy.one/data/bookmarks.json) that populates this page. This approach lets me use an interactive interface to build my bookmarks database without needing a dynamic site.
