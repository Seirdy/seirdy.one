It looks like the Tor Browser is finally addressing some of the accessibility issues inherent to its fingerprinting resistance, starting with [Issue 42226: Reduce Customisability of default fonts and colours](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/42226) The propsed fix of curating common "sets" of settings would add some entropy to everybody's fingerprint but allow more people to use the browser overall, as it would support some degree of personalization (e.g. dark mode).

I welcome the change. Anonymity should be accessible.
