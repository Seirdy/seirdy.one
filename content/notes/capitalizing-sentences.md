I always like having at least two ways to visually express meaning:

- Code blocks should have a change in font, and have a border.
- Description lists should have a hanging indent, and have bold described-terms.
- Hyperlinks should have color, and an underline.

For sentences: punctuation, and capitalization. It also makes initialisms less likely to be confused with the end of a sentence, e.g. this one.
