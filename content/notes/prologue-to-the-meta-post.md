I've been planning on writing a big "meta" post explaining how this site is built, but first I want to reach a few milestones, most of which are IndieWeb-related. Here's what I've already done:

- Microformats
- More semantic markup: Creative Commons and Schema.org vocabularies
- Web sign-in (using an IndieAuth service)
- multiple types of posts
- Sending Webmentions
- Displaying Webmentions
- User-sendable Webmentions with a form
- RSS feeds for posts and notes
- Atom feed for posts and notes with ActivityStreams metadata
- Automatic POSSE of bookmarks to TinyGem (bookmarking service)

However, I still have a ways to go. Here's what I plan on adding:

- Add some semantic markup to list online "friends", probably using [FOAF ontology](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/)
- Preview Webmention entry contents
- Related to previous point: create a blogroll
- Automatic POSSE of notes to Fedi (it's mostly manual right now)
- Combined Atom feed
- WebSub
- Permalinks for bookmarks
- Atom feed for bookmarks
- Automatic POSSE of bookmarks to Fedi
- Time-period based pagination/navigation on notes/posts page.

Once I finish the above, I'll be ready for a "meta" post. Some more tasks after that:

- Run my own WebSub hub.
- Add my own front-end for search results (my first non-static content).
- Pingback support
- Create a webring. What I've learned while doing the above will inform inclusion criteria.
