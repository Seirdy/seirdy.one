What if Firefox and Chromium placed a year-long moratorium on all new browser features unrelated to security, accessibility, and internationalization? Effort not spent on those initiatives could be re-directed towards bugfixes.

Defining the word "major" might be hard but I think it's an interesting idea.

I'm not too worried about including Safari since it could spend those months catching up.
