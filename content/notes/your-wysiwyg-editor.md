Would love to see something that conforms properly to the WAI Authoring practices and supports microformats2. That could combine well with a stylesheet that doesn't use any custom classes, just microformats classes and `role` attribute selectors.

My current site doesn't actually use any classes in the CSS apart from `image-rendering` utility classes; I use POSH, ARIA and microformats selectors for everything else.

The great thing about a purely semantic stylesheet is re-usability across other websites.
