[This page at the time of writing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240623192730/https://dillo-browser.github.io/pec/) grades websites' progressive enhancement based on their ability to work without JavaScript. Everything, not just JavaScript, should be progressive enhancements.

HTML elements already have progressive enhancement built-in. CSS, JS, and embedded content should be progressively enhanced too. The page should make sense without scripts and styles, alt-text should be available in the absence of embedded media, etc. We shouldn't put scripting on a pedestal above everything else.

I suggest replacing references to JavaScript with references to non-HTML content. See also: ["curlable" on the IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/curlable).

A more minor piece of feedback: I'd suggest re-sizing the badges to 88-by-31 pixels if possible. It's a very popular size for badges; at these dimensions, they would look good alongside others of the same size ([examples from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Icons)).
