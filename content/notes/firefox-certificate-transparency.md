[Firefox 136 looks poised to enforce Certificate Transparency](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1927085).

It may be late, but combined with CRLite ([and its other Web PKI progress]({{<relref "/posts/post-ocsp-revocation/#aside-browser-wars">}})), it seems to now be the browser with the most robust Web PKI support.

While I would still say that Chromium generally wins on the security front, I'm happy to see the gap narrow with time and to see Firefox occasionally inch ahead in some areas.
