People have mostly moved on from DTDs. In HTML-land, they use the Living Standard; in XML land, they stick to boring existing parsing rules and use XML namespaces. In both, they use RDF vocabularies to describe RDF-based structured data.

I'm curious as to why you're interested in creating a new DTD. I think that unless you plan on creating a new SGML-based language, you're better served by namespaces.
