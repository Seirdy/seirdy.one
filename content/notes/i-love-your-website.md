When I talk about website accessibility, I think a lot of people get stressed out and wonder if their personal site passes a really high bar. Some feel pressure to pass every single accessibility requirement they can.

Take a deep breath.

Your beautiful hand-coded personal site is probably better than the vast majority of sites I've complained about. Do not feel ashamed of what you've made. You've built your own pedestal to share yourself with the world, and nothing I say can take that from you because it is yours.

Trying to pass WCAG guidelines is a really noble goal, but don't make it turn your personal site into a source of panic and stress. Take things slowly. Look at one criterion a day. One criterion a week. Ask people for feedback instead of doing it all on your own.
