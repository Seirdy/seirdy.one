CNET actually didn't have to delete old articles to improve ranking. If CNET simply removed those articles from its sitemap, used [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) to inform Google (and IndexNow to inform Bing, Seznam, and Yandex) of new higher-priority pages, and maybe used `robots.txt` to disallow crawling of stale pages: CNET could keep old content but prioritize the crawling of recent content. Nothing I just described is Google-specific; these are all agreed-upon standards that work across several search engines.

I suppose it's easier to just delete pages, though. Less labor means fewer expenses. After all, this is the outlet that [cut costs with algorithmically-generated articles](https://gizmodo.com/cnet-ai-chatgpt-tech-news-1850017739).
