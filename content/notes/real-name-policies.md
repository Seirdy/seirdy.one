The primary, hopefully-unintended function of a "real-name policy" is to exclude people and make people *less* genuine. Many aren't at home with the name deemed by society to be "real".

There's plural systems. And trans users who haven't made a full break from their deadname(s) yet. And at-risk users who would be doxed by such a policy. And folks who simply feel more comfortable with online handles than meatspace names, for no special reason in particular.

What incredible benefits could be worth shafting all these people?
