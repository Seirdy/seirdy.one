One thing I don't like is faux corporate support for pride month. Think rainbow branding for large organizations that don't actually do much to improve the systems they benefit from.

A good smoke test to see if rainbow-flag/BLM-repping organizations actually give a shit: test their website's accessibility. If they ignore disabled users *because* they're a minority with different needs, well, that probably speaks volumes regarding their attitudes towards any minority. Actions speak louder than words.

They don't care about minorities; they're only in if for the branding. When a soulless organization uses your symbols, it remains soulless.

Soulless organizations don't have good or evil intent. {{<mention-work itemtype="VideoObject">}}{{<indieweb-person itemprop="author" first-name="Bryan" last-name="Cantrill" url="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/">}} put this best in his talk {{<cited-work name="Fork Yeah!
