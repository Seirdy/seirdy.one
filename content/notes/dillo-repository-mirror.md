Dillo's domain name has expired, making it impossible to fetch its Mercurial repository from its canonical location. Fortunately, Mercurial is a distributed version control system, and I had a copy. [I pushed my copy to hg.sr.ht](https://hg.sr.ht/~seirdy/dillo-mirror); you can see it there.

The Wayback Machine also has [recent snapshots of dillo.org from May.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220511073123/https://www.dillo.org/)

I imagine that at least a few people have copies of the mailing list archives.
