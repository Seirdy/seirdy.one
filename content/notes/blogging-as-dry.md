The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (<abbr>DRY</abbr>) principle is my main motivation for adding content to my site---especially to [my "notes" section]({{<relref "/notes">}}). I've gone as far as linking my own website in online class discussions (not as a citation; just for <abbr>DRY</abbr>).

This also combines really well with the [Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (<abbr>POSSE</abbr>) principle. Often, a post of mine syndicates well to multiple destinations. I might reply to a forum on my site and syndicate it to both that forum and to the Fediverse. People reply in both places, and Webmentions aggregate them together on my site (though I often have to send myself those mentions). I only have to write something once.
