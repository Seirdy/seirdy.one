I'm in partial agreement with this take.

On one hand, expectations change with time. Most people outside my bubble look at interfaces I like using and say they look "ugly" and that they're "weird" (their words); they wouldn't have said that when I was younger.

On the other hand, some "annoyances" are actually removable _barriers_. Accessibility comes to mind. If you take software that does not work with assistive technologies (ATs) and fix it, AT-users might move on to the next accessibility issue. But they'll be markedly happier than before, when they just couldn't use it.

Similar examples include localization and compatibility.

Man, positive takes like this feel really out of character for me.
