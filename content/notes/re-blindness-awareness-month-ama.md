The most common and major accessibility (<abbr title="accessibility">a11y</abbr>) issues tend to be documented and well-known among <abbr>a11y</abbr> practitioners; however, "smaller" or "niche" issues (for lack of a better term) tend to go unnoticed. For instance, I recently learned that over-use of soft-hyphens can trip up the speech synthesis of the NVDA screen reader, and styling superscripts/subscripts a certain way can stop screen readers from announcing them. I also learned about how performance issues can cause delays in screen readers, making content exposed to screen readers fall out-of-sync with the actual page. We won't learn about this in accessibility tutorials or W3C documentation! The only way to discover these issues is to use many screen readers for a long time.

What are some accessibility hazards---or even mild annoyances---you experience, that you _don't_ think most <abbr>a11y</abbr> practitioners learn about? Is there a common annoyance you wouldn't normally bring up because it seems "too minor"?
