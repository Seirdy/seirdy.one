The only engines I know of that run JavaScript are Google, Bing, and maybe Petal. None of the other engines in my list appear to support it. I don't even think Yandex does.

It's common practice for sites to give a JavaScript-lite version to search engines, though if the content differs heavily you run the risk of hitting a manual action. I'd imagine that search-crawler-exclusive editions would become the norm if crawlers stopped handling JavaScript.

Marginalia actually seems to penalize its use.

<p><ins>Update: Yep (formerly FairSearch) also seems to evaluate JavaScript</ins></p>
