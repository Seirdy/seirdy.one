I propose an alternative to the [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) called the Living Dead Internet Theory, an exaggerated version of my actual beliefs:

1. Any content written to optimize against algorithmic curation is as bad as algorithmically generated content.
2. Algorithmically-curated content is disproportionally biased towards content optimized for said algorithm.
3. The most accessible content might as well be written by bots.

Don't use short-tail search queries for discovery.
