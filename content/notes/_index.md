# Notes

This is my microblog, containing short informal entries. They're longer than most posts on microblogging networks (some would call this a "miniblog" instead), but a fraction of the size of the longer entries on  [my blog](../posts/). Most posts are under 300 words.

[An Atom feed](./atom.xml) contains the full text of all my notes. If that has any problems, I also have [a legacy RSS feed](./index.xml).
