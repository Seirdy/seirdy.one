[MoonScript](https://moonscript.org/) (a language with a CoffeeScript-like syntax that transpiles to Lua) continues to be the most enjoyable programming language I have ever used.

It's not the most practical choice for everything; I probably would choose something else for a big collaborative project. But it's an absolute joy to use something that truly feels like "executable pseudocode", like a simpler Python alternative with a bias towards functional programming. If you can grok Lua's "tables for everything" model, then [the MoonScript language guide](https://moonscript.org/reference/) should help you pick up the language in minutes.

If we had a "gradually typed" MoonScript to target [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) instead of Lua, I'd probably use it for everything.
