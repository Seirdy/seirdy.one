Fedora is a stable distro now, with three levels of pre-release: Rawhide is unstable, Branched is *sort of* like an alpha release, and Beta is for early adopters.

Fedora is just semi-rolling, with a combination of soft-frozen and rolling packages. Each release gets just over a year of support, so you can double-upgrade on alternate releases if you wish.

It’s obviously no Debian but it’s not the bleeding edge distro it once was. Each release has the latest toolchains and runtimes but it’s not generally as bleeding edge as e.g. Arch.

Strictly speaking, Fedora stable releases technically aren't even upstream RHEL anymore; CentOS Stream pulls right from Rawhide.
