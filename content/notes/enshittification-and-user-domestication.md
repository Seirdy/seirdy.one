I admit that I feel salty about the word "enshittification" taking off instead of my phrase for the same thing: ["user domestication"]({{<relref "/posts/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.md">}}). I prefer the latter because it emphasizes the gross disrespect so many platforms show their users, and how the lack of autonomy/mobility naturally leads to enshittification.

Any platform able to get away with enshittification will do so when given the incentive. Enshittification emphasizes the process of a platform's downfall; we should be taking steps to prevent that from happening in the first place by [keeping platforms open]({{<relref "/posts/keeping-platforms-open.md">}}). Vigilance against enshittification is misplaced when better spent against user domestication.
