When I use my legal rights to request an organization to delete my data...

1. Do they also un-teach their ML models everything they learned from my data?
2. Can they infer the missing information from that model without storing it?
3. Do they also have data that isn't currently attributed to me, but can be attributed to me in the future?

These are rhetorical questions because you can probably guess the answers. Simple data deletion is a cop-out from the impossible task of un-learning. Consent isn't as meaningful if it isn't fully revocable.
