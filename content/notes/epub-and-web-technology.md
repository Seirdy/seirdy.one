To be fair: EPUB is actually a good use-case for semantic XHTML5,  WAI-ARIA, DPUB-ARIA, MathML, and RDF serializations. This does call for some sort of web engine,  but not necessarily a complete browser engine capable of running web apps.

Most of the rest of the Web platform beyond semantic markup and simple stylesheets should probably be stripped away from a typical EPUB reader. Unfortunately, few "slim" engines actually support enough of the features I described. Engines like Ultralight (proprietary) and [litehtml](https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml) come to mind, but I don't know how good the latter's accessibility support is.

I very much agree that JavaScript support in EPUB was a mistake; fortunately, it's seldom necessary. Signed JIT-less JavaScript as part of the e-reader program should be okay, as the user consented to run it.
