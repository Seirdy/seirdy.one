I noticed that the <cite>[Comparison of ways to use vocabulary in content](https://github.com/w3c/adapt/wiki/Comparison-of-ways-to-use-vocabulary-in-content)</cite> page on the personalization-semantics wiki didn't mention Microformats. Microformats add semantic meaning to individual HTML elements; this is in contrast to document-level semantic formats like Microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD.

There's a 1-1 mapping between many microformats and values in [the WAI-Adapt Content Module](https://w3c.github.io/adapt/symbols/index.html). Several values under section 4.3.4 (values for "purpose") are already specified in [`h-card` microformats2](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card), for instance. You can find plenty of live `h-card` implementations on [the IndieWeb Webring directory](https://üï∏üíç.ws/directory).

[w3c/coga Issue 69](https://github.com/w3c/coga/issues/69) also references overlap between "destination" vocabulary and `rel` values. Microformats leverage `rel` attributes like [`rel="license"`](https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license) and [`rel="home"`](https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-home); these seem equivalent to the "terms" and "home" values for destination attributes.

I propose the addition of microformats2 to the comparison wiki page, and would support either merging the content module with microformats or specifying a mapping for fallback.

<ins>Update <time>2022-10-31</time>: the Content module has since been re-named to the Symbols module; I've updated the link in the this post.</ins>
