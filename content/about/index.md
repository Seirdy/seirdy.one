Other versions of this website
------------------------------

This page also exists on the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/), a bunch of \*nix computers that let people sign up for shell accounts. A typical shell account features clients for IRC and email, common terminal/commandline utilities, and (most importantly) web hosting. Read about the tildeverse's [origins](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917091804/https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf), read [the FAQ](https://tilde.club/wiki/faq.html), pick [a tilde](https://tilde.club/%7Epfhawkins/othertildes.html) and [get started](https://tilde.club/~anthonydpaul/primer.html). My Tildeverse pages will serve as a "rough draft".

Location (Seirdy, online)
-------------------------

My handle is "Seirdy" on all the platforms I use.

- The [Tildeverse](https://envs.net/~seirdy).
- Software forges: [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~seirdy), [GitHub](https://github.com/Seirdy), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Seirdy), and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Seirdy).
- Social (federated): I'm [@Seirdy<wbr>@pleroma<wbr>.envs.net](https://pleroma.envs.net/seirdy) on the Fediverse.
- Social (non-federated): I'm Seirdy on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Seirdy), [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/Seirdy), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Seirdy/), [Tildes.net](https://tildes.net/user/Seirdy), and Linux Weekly News.
- Email: my address is [seirdy<wbr>@seirdy.one](mailto:seirdy@seirdy.one). I typically sign my emails with my public PGP key: [`1E892DB2A5F84479`](./publickey.asc). My key is also available via WKD.
- Chat: for IRC, my nick is Seirdy on Libera.chat, Snoonet, OFTC, Tilde.Chat, and a few smaller networks. I'm also [@seirdy<wbr>:seirdy.one](https://matrix.to/#/@seirdy:seirdy.one) on Matrix.

My secondary Matrix account for Synapse-only rooms is `@seirdy:fairydust.space`. My Matrix account used to be `@seirdy:envs.net` but I've since migrated to my own Conduit server.

If you find a "Seirdy" somewhere else and don't know whether or not it's me, please contact me and ask instead of assuming that it must be me.

My preferred forge for personal projects is Sourcehut, but my repositories have remotes for GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg too.

Selected projects
-----------------

### [Clogstats](https://sr.ht/~seirdy/clogstats/)

Analyze WeeChat logs to quantify, graph, forecast, and perform anomaly-detection on IRC channel activity. Written in Python; uses Pandas.

### [MOAC](https://sr.ht/~seirdy/MOAC/)

Generate passwords and analyze password strength given physical limits to computing. Based on a weblog/gemlog entry: [Becoming physically immune to brute-force attacks](https://seirdy.one/2021/01/12/password-strength.html). Written in Go.

Interests, preferences, et cetera
---------------------------------

I ought to come up with more interests than these, but that sounds hard.

### Free software

The word "free" in "free software" refers to freedom, not price. I recommend looking it up if you aren't familiar. That being said, I think that simply meeting the definition of free software isn't enough: it's one of multiple requirements for software to avoid the possibility of [user domestication](https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html).

I lean towards simplicity; I usually prefer CLIs that follow the UNIX philosophy over TUIs, and TUIs over GUIs. If a piece of software is complex enough to require a funding round, I would rather avoid it. There are exceptions, of course: I use a Linux distro with Systemd (Fedora), after all.

Some software I use: Fedora, Alpine Linux, SwayWM, mpv, mpd, Minetest, Neovim, tmux, newsboat, WeeChat, Foot, and zsh.

More information is available in my [dotfiles repo](https://sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles); check its README.

### Anime

I watch anime. Some of my favorites, in no particular order:

- Code Geass
- Mawaru Penguindrum
- No Game No Life: Zero
- Darling in the Franxx
- Black Lagoon
- Serial Experiments Lain
- Saga of Tanya the Evil
- Monogatari
- Attack on Titan

### Music

I've put together a periodically-updated [list of tracks](music.txt) that I've rated 8/10 or higher in my mpd stickers database, auto-generated by some of my [mpd-scripts](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/mpd-scripts/tree/master/smart-playlists). I'm a fan of glitch, trailer music, and symphonic and power metal; I've also recently been getting into Japanese rock thanks to a few anime openings. Some of my favorite artists are The Glitch Mob, Pretty Lights, Beats Antique, Hammerfall, Badflower, Celldweller and Scandroid, Helloween, Two Steps from Hell, Nightwish, Mili, and MYTH & ROID.
