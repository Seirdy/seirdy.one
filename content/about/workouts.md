I document my low-equipment at-home workout regiment. I currently do a three-day split: arms, back, and legs. Years ago, I had access to a gym. Now, I do the best I can at home with weights and bands.

I can't do a push/pull split: I don't have enough push-based exercises to do with my equipment and limitations.

I am closer to novice than expert. People have written books about this. Read those if you want serious advice. This is mostly something I hope to share with others when I seek advice _from_ them (see [the "current questions" section](#current-questions)).

## Constraints

### Equipment used


Adjustable dumbbells
: Currently adjustable from 5 to 70 pounds, in increments 5 pounds.

Resistance bands
: Includes compact, therapy, and loop bands.

Backpack
: Filled with weight to power-up bodyweight exercises.

Ankle weights
: I sometimes put these on my wrists during dumbbell exercises for exercises I'm maxed out on, or load them into the backpack to make it heavier.

Push-up handles
: My first piece of exercise equipment! I always use these; push-ups feel incomplete without them.

A bed
: It isn't too strong, so I only use it as a resistance band anchor for face-pulls. It also serves as a bench, though without the adjustability or arm-mobility that a real exercise bench offers.

All my equipment fits under the bed or in a shopping bag.

### What I lack

- Lots of space

- Heavy furniture. I can't anchor resistance bands without also using a limb to hold the furniture in place, and I have to be careful about how I anchor so I don't damage it.

- A chin-up bar. ðŸ˜­

- Time: well, it's complicated. Most workouts can fit within <time datetime="PT1H">one hour</time> if I stay focused, excluding a light warm-up less than <time datetime="PT30M">30 minutes</time> before I start. Commuting to a gym would take time (and cost money). The hour between my pre-workout carb-filled meal and my workout is some of the only free time I have in a day, and I don't want to lose any of it shuffling between the gym and home/work.

## Motivations

Why do I work out? In descending order of priority:


Emotional support
: Setting goals, meeting them, improving over time, and releasing bottled-up energy gives me a rush that I badly need. I have a bad history of getting hooked on idle and incremental games for instant gratification; increasing weight and counting steps is healthier.

Focus
: Finishing a workout on time without getting distracted is hard for me, but practice translates into improving focus in other places. I'm not trying to "cure" my <abbr>ADHD</abbr> but I do want the _ability_ to focus on a long task till completion when I need to.

Aesthetics and strength
: These are tied, and my priority changes constantly. Everyday tasks becoming easier is the most incredible feeling of power in the world. Looking at myself in the mirror and feeling proud gives me purpose.

Endurance
: Not getting tired after prolonged activity is a plus. Minor.

Balance and mobility
: I'm mostly interested in these when they're a bottleneck for other exercises. For example, Bulgarian split squats require some balance. Minor.

## My workouts

My three-day split is arms, back and legs. I split each one down to muscle groups and compound exercises.

Between sets for a single exercise, I take <time datetime="PT0M30S">30 seconds</time> of rest. Between different exercises for a single muscle group, I take <time datetime="PT1M">one minute</time> of rest. Switching muscle groups warrants a longer break, if time permits.

Unless otherwise stated, I target three sets of 8-12 reps (ideally 9-10) for a given exercise. If I'm in the mood for strength instead of hypertrophy, I target fewer reps (ideally 6-8) with more weight and twice the rest. I only do this for the exercises I'm most comfortable with, and never for forearms.

**I do not (usually) do every exercise in a given workout.** I only do every exercise if I've had an _awful_ day and _need_ an emotional outlet, usually with reduced weight. Doing every exercise in some categories is somewhat redundant. I always do compound exercises, and exercises labelled with "High priority".

I preface each workout with a warm-up within 30 minutes of starting it. This includes some light cardio, mobility (no heavy stretching!), and one additional documented exercise with little weight.

### Arm day

Not the most intense workout, but the longest one with the most exercises. Warm-up should include bodyweight elbow-in push-ups. I often superset between shoulder and upper-arm exercises to speed things up.

If it's a day off, I can do every single exercise listed. Doing so takes under <time datetime="PT1H30M">90 minutes</time> if I stay focused.

#### Compound arm

Four sets of push-ups: two decline and two flat.

1. Decline push-ups with elbows in, with a weighted backpack and extension handles. High priority, 2 sets.
2. Same as previous but without the decline. High priority, 2 sets.

#### Shoulders

Some of these also work out the traps quite well. I usually do the Arnold press and a rear-deltoid fly, but sometimes I do a shoulder concentration and hit every exercise in this section.

3. Arnold press (full deltoid). High priority.
4. Standing dumbbell overhead press (anterior and lateral deltoid). Low priority.
5. Lateral raise (lateral deltoid).
6. Front raise (anterior deltoid).
7. Horizontal rear-deltoid fly with therapy bands (rear deltoid).

If I feel satisfied after a few Arnold press sets, skip the standing dumbbell overhead press.

#### Upper arm segment

8. Standing banded overhead extensions (triceps).
9. Hammerhead curls (brachii, some forearm).
10. Reverse curls (brachii, forearms). High priority.
11. Bicep concentration curls (biceps). High priority.

#### Forearms and grip strength

This is the hard part. Forearm exercises have the highest difficulty for me, and results don't come easily. There exist many different forearm muscles, such as those controlling individual finger movements. Instead of targeting specific muscles, I target specific movements.

I go easy on this section if I'm including some back-day exercises in arm-day. Many back-day exercises, such as weighted lunges or farmer's carry, incorporate forearm endurance.

Grip strength is a major bottleneck for me, so I pay extra attention to this part of the workout.

12. Wrist/finger curls
13. Reverse wrist/finger curls (requires very little weight: less than 12.5 pounds)
14. Sideways wrist/finger curls
15. Behind-the-back wrist/finger curls with bands.
16. Forearm twists. High priority.

I also have a hand gripper and finger resistance bands to really hone in on grip strength. For forearm twists, I stop when my grip weakens; this always happens before my forearms weaken.

### Back day

My hardest workout, but the most rewarding. Warm-up should include light renegade rows (20 pounds or less).

I'm considering bringing deltoid exercises from arm-day to back day when I have sufficient time. There's enough overlap.

I can't over-emphasize how transformative this has been for my quality of life. Chores like laundry are a breeze when I can carry several loads (sheets, clothes, shower curtain, towels, tablecloths, and detergent for two!) in a single trip thanks to back-day gains. I find running much easier with good posture and strong lats.

Back day has my two favorite exercises: Kroc rows and renegade rows. I love back day so much!

#### Compound back

Pick either standard rows or bent-over rows, depending on my mood.

1. Renegade rows. High priority. A compound exercise, but it hits my lats _hard._
2. Farmer's carry. High priority, if weather permits (I do this outside).
3. Standard rows.
4. Bent-over rows.
5. Wide push-ups with a backpack and extension handles. High priority.

#### Lats

6. Dumbbell deadlifts, optionally combined with trap shrugs. High priority, 4 sets.
7. Hip rows (more of a compound exercise but modified to hit the lats harder).
8. Kroc rows.
9. Dumbbell lat pullover.

#### Scapula, serratus

These muscles can assist in other arm movements. They're not important to train on their own because they're secondary muscles in other exercises. With enough time available, I may spend a moment on them. I fit these into my workout once a week.

10. Scapular push-ups. Just 1-2 sets upon exhaustion from wide push-ups.
11. Diagonal resistance band pull-apart.

#### Traps

It's hard to do traps well without an incline to lie on. This is what I have for now.

12. Face pulls with resistance bands. High priority.
13. Upright rows, leaning slightly forwards (pump! pump!). High priority.
14. Trap shrugs. Also a light deltoid workout.

I'm considering splitting these across upper, middle, and lower trapezius and grouping upper traps with deltoids.

### Leg day

The workout that leaves me feeling the most sore afterwards. Warm-up should include bodyweight jumping squats or burpees (light cardio).

This is my shortest and most frequent workout. I often do this on days when I have little time, and to separate arm-day from back-day due to their overlap.

Most of these exercises hit the glutes hard, so I made no section dedicated to glutes.

#### Quads

These are all compound and high priority, but really nail the quads.

1. Jumping goblet squats with dumbbell and backpack. High priority.
2. Standard dumbbell squats.
3. Forward lunges.
4. Bulgarian split squats. Low priority.

#### Hamstrings

5. Dumbbell stiff-leg deadlift, targeting hamstrings.
6. Hip thrusts. High priority.
7. Rear lunges.

I do rear lunges by stepping off a rolled-up mat for an extra decline.

#### Hips

8. Clamshells with loop bands and ankle weights on thighs (to anchor them in place).
9. Lateral leg raises with loop resistance bands and ankle weights.
10. Lateral band walk.

#### Calves

11. Calf raises with a reverse backpack and dumbbell.

I spend most of my leg-day time on compound exercises.

Sometimes I drop calf raises and do those on other days instead. By postponing calves, I can cram leg day into just 30 minutes.

### Cardio

If it's a day off and I'm up for it: I go for a run <time datetime="PT2H">two hours</time> after my post-workout meal. I pace myself for high-intensity interval training by alternating between slow jogs and almost-sprints. I've been slacking on this lately. Sorry.

On work days, I go for low-impact training. I try to take over 14,000 steps (ten thousand at minimum, 12 thousand weekly average), using a dedicated digital pedometer. Skipping some bus stops while waiting for the bus, taking longer routes, pacing instead of standing still, and walking part of the way home are more than enough.

I do not lose sleep over the number being a little too low; hyper-focusing on numbers isn't healthy.

## Current questions

- Is there any mostly-redundant group of exercises that I should cut down on in favor of more sets?

- Should I move deltoids to back day? If so, back day will be huge. Could I then move lats to leg day, given their overlap with e.g. squats?

- Pecs are secondary muscles in many of these exercises. Are there more exercises I can do for them? If so, during which split? See the next question too.

- Is it worth doing a dumbbell chest press without a bench to let me do the full extension, or should I focus on the other exercises I listed instead?

- Do I have any under-trained muscles, especially on leg day?

- Are there any online forums you'd recommend, given my exercise-related interests?
